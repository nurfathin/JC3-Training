This is the dataset of car parks that includes latitude and longitude coordinates along with a value at risk attribute. 

1. Each car park's precise geographic location is specified by the latitude and longitude coordinates.
2. The "value at risk" attribute provides an estimate of the potential financial loss or risk associated with each car park.
